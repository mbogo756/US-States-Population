# üìä US States Population Analysis (1950 ‚Äì 2015)

Interactive Power BI report exploring population trends for every U.S. state from 1950 through 2015.
The project highlights long-term growth patterns and regional differences, providing both high-level summaries and detailed state-by-state insights.

## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this dashboard is to analyze and visualize population change across the United States over 65 years.
Users can slice the data by Census Region, Division, or individual state to uncover patterns, compare areas, and evaluate growth across any custom time interval.

**‚ú® Features & Highlights**

**Problem Statement**
- Understand how populations have evolved across U.S. states, and identify which regions and divisions have experienced the most growth since 1950.

**Dashboard Goals**

- Provide a single, interactive view of population by Region, Division, and State.

- Enable time-series analysis to track growth trends and compare different areas.

**Key Visuals**

1.Map with regional and country borders, interactive tooltip showing each state‚Äôs full 1950-2015 population trend.

2. Hierarchical Slicer (Region ‚Üí Division ‚Üí State) filtering all visuals simultaneously.

3. Table summarizing 2015 population by region, division, and country.

4. Bar Chart counting census divisions by census region.

5. Ribbon Chart showing population changes by year and state.

6. Growth Table & Slicer on a second page to calculate population growth between any two selected years.
